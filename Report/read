In our project, we also need to consider critical point. As we known, double-card game has two sections. Regular section and recycling section. In regular section, be-fore 24th step, when AI use minmax or alpha-beta to select a position, it simulates human’s selected position with regular move. However, in 24th step, when AI do that, it need to simulate human’s selected position with recycling move. This is critical point problem.
Same as above, in recycling section, before 60th step, when AI use minmax or alpha-beta to select a position, the depth is default value. However, in 60th step, when AI do that, it need to set depth to 1. This is because the 60th step is game over step, AI do not need to simulate human’s selected position
